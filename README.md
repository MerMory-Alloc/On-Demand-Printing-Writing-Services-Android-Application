# On-Demand Printing and Writing Services Android App

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for our Final Year Project, which is developed as a part of the requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems at the University Djillali Liabes of Sidi Bel Abbes. Our project aims to create an Android mobile app for On-Demand Printing and Writing services. The app is designed to benefit print shop owners, writers, and anyone with access to a printer. Additionally, it will be a valuable tool for students, teachers, professors, and anyone involved in the academic field.

The primary objective of our project is to create a digital marketplace that facilitates the request and provision of printing and writing services. This platform will enable clients to make online service requests and assist service providers in managing these requests efficiently.
